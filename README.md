# Tod

Plan and manage daily tasks. Deliberately simple so I can stay focused on what I need to do.

Saves tasks in an easy to read plaintext file in the root folder called `~/.tod`.

### CLI Commands:

* `a[n]` - (A)dd task at index `n`
* `c[n]` - Set (C)ompletion of task `n`
* `d[n]` - (D)elete task `n`
* `dd` - Delete all tasks
* `e[n]` - (E)dit task `n`
* `h` - Print the (H)elp menu
* `m[n]` - (M)ove task `n`
* `q` - (Q)uit
* `r` - (R)educe/remove the completed tasks from the list
* `s` - (S)tart a new set of daily tasks

### Future Improvements

* Integrate with Track
	* Pull MIT from previous day and add it on `s`tart
	* Have Track pull completed tasks from list for accomplishment tracking
